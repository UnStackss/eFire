This program scans a specified directory, generates a YAML representation of its structure, and saves it in a file. It then uploads the YAML file to Pastebin for easy sharing. The program features animated banners, loading bars, and custom console icons (Windows only). It supports UTF-8 output and provides an interactive, user-friendly experience.
